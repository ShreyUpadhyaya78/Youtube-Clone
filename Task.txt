Task: Clone YouTube page (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK35ulIX5P4)
Assumption: You are logged into the app
Folder Structure
index.html: The main HTML file.
css/: Folder for CSS files.
js/: Folder for JavaScript files.
assets/
images/: Folder for images.
fonts/: Folder for font files.
data/: Folder for hard coded data for different section of app, ex: comments.json
UI implementation
The end result should be the exact clone of the video player page in youtube
	Considerations
Should be responsive
Should have consistent coloring, fonts, etc
Should incorporate UX elements (pointer on hover, clickable links, tooltips)
Video player is not needed to look like Youtube’s player. Would be great if made so.
Functionality required
Headers
Search section should be interactive, should display a dropdown with some hardcoded default search history, but no need to implement the actual search behaviour
Upload new video section only interactive until the modal opens with menu items - clicking on menu items does nothing
For notifications, have some default notifications and clicking on it opens a modal
Video Player
Video should be automatically played when landing on the page. Just like the actual site. Put hardcoded youtube link
Include Player Controls like Play/Pause, Next (Modal displaying next recommended video thumbnail), Audio Control and Visual Controls like Cinema Mode/Default View, Full Screen toggles, Settings to only open modal with different menu items (leave it as unclickable for now, no further action on clicking any item in the menu)
Recommended Videos
When clicked on any one of the videos from the recommended videos section a new video should be played (hardcode the link)
Add tag based filter on the recommended videos
Like & Share
Like & Dislike
Should be able to like the video and the count should change upon liking the video
Share
Should open a modal with multiple options to share
“Share in a post” only for visual purpose - not functional
Share on any two social media platforms, more than two only for display purpose
When clicking on any social media, it should open the corresponding app with prefilled default contents - the data are shared via url
Say, if you choose to share implement share behaviour for Facebook and Twitter, others are left non-functional
Section to Copy the original youtube url should be functional
Comments Section
Have an input to allow posting comments
Display the list of some hard coded comments, but adding new comments should be displayed as well
Sort comments (Top Comments & Newest First)
Only display the replies to hardcoded comments (skip posting new replies)
